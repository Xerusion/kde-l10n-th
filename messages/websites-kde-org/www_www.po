We find this transformation incomprehensible, moreover when NGI has proven efficient and economical to support free software as a whole, from the smallest to the most established initiatives. This ecosystem diversity backs the strength of European technological innovation, and maintaining the NGI initiative to provide structural support to software projects at the heart of worldwide innovation is key to enforce the sovereignty of a European infrastructure. Contrary to common perception, technical innovations often originate from European rather than North American programming communities, and are mostly initiated by small-scaled organizations."

New in KDE Gear 21.08 is that, if a folder contains a lot of previewable files, it will show you an animated sequence of previews so you can check to see if the folder contains what you are looking for. Dolphin also shows previews for files inside encrypted locations, such as Plasma Vaults. Dolphin's preview code has also been optimized in this version and thumbnails now pop up faster."

You use motion tracking if you want an element to follow something else that is moving around in the frame. Say you want to blur out a child's face, but they are moving around, or you want a label with text to follow a character as they walk across the frame. Locate _Motion Tracker_ in the list effects and drag and drop it into the clip you want to track.

Next, select both clips (hold down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key and click on one clip, and then, still holding down <kbd>Shift</kbd>, click on the other); hit the <kbd>u</kbd> key and... Hey presto!

It is meant as a base for testing and gathering feedback to ensure that the initial stable release of Plasma 5 in July will be a smooth ride for everybody involved and lay a stable foundation for future versions. Plasma 5 is intended for end users, but will not provide feature parity with the latest 4.x release, which will come in follow-up version. The team is concentrating on the core desktop features first, instead of trying to transplant every single feature into the new workspaces. The feature set presented in Plasma 5.0 will suffice for most users, though some might miss a button here and there. This is not because the Plasma team wants to remove features, but simply that not everything has been done yet. Of course, everybody is encouraged to help bringing Plasma back to its original feature set and beyond."

"The new Breeze theme, which is still in its infancy, welcomes the user with a <strong>cleaner, modernized user interface</strong>, which improves contrast and reduces visual clutter throughout the workspace. Stronger reliance on typography eases the recognition of UI elements. These changes go together with flatter default theming and improved contrast to improve visual clarity further. Breeze being a new artwork concept, is only starting to show its face. A theme for the workspace components is already available, theming of traditional widgets is under way, and the work on a new icon theme has commenced. The migration to a fully Breeze-themed workspace will be a gradual one, with its first signs showing up in Plasma 5.0.<br />"
" Plasma 5 brings a <strong>greater level of flexibility and consistency</strong> to core components of the desktop. The widget explorer, window and activity switcher now share a common interaction scheme. More reliance on vertical instead of horizontal lists provides better usability. Moving the window switcher to the side of the screen shifts the user&#x27;s focus towards the applications and documents, clearing the stage for the task at hand."

msgid "Further progress has been made on Wayland support. A new window manager binary 'kwin_wayland' now complements the existing 'kwin_x11', and is equipped with the ability to start a nested X server for compatibility with X11-based applications. A newly-created KWayland library provides Wayland setup information to KInfoCenter and other consumers. More work is needed and ongoing to run the Plasma workspace on Wayland; we expect this to bear fruit for end-users in 2015."

While many features known from the Plasma 4.x series are already available in Plasma 5.1, not all of them have been ported and made available for Plasma 5 yet. As with any software release of this size, there may be bugs that make a migration to Plasma 5 hard for some users. The development team would like to hear about issues you may run into, so they can be addressed and fixed. We have compiled a <a href=\"https://community.kde.org/Plasma/5.1_Errata\">list of problems</a> we are aware of, and working on. Users can expect monthly bugfix updates. A release bringing new features and brinding back even more old features will be made in early 2015."

We have spent the last four months optimising startup and minimising memory usage, yielding faster time-to-desktop, better runtime performance and less memory consumption. Basic features like panel popups were optimised to make sure they run smoothly even on the lowest-end hardware. Our design teams have not rested either, producing beautiful new integrated lock and login screen graphics."

There is a completely rewritten notification system supporting Do Not Disturb mode, more intelligent history with grouping, critical notifications in fullscreen apps, improved notifications for file transfer jobs, a much more usable System Settings page to configure everything, and many other things. The System and Widget Settings have been refined and worked on by porting code to newer Kirigami and Qt technologies and polishing the user interface. And of course the VDG and Plasma team effort towards <a href=\"https://community.kde.org/Goals/Usability_%26_Productivity\">Usability & Productivity goal</a> continues, getting feedback on all the papercuts in our software that make your life less smooth and fixing them to ensure an intuitive and consistent workflow for your daily use."

X11 windows can connect to this server as if it were a normal X server, for KWin it looks like a Wayland window, though. This means that KWin learned to handle Wayland windows in this release, though full integration is only expected for Plasma 5.4."

Speaking of which, from Plasma 5.22 onwards, KWin supports variable refresh rate/FreeSync screens on Wayland. This means that if you have more than one screen and each of them has a different refresh rate, you can configure each one individually so video playback and games will look perfect regardless of which one they are displayed on."

msgid "Another thing that contributes to a good video experience in Wayland is that KWin can now set a screen's overscan value. This ensures that none of the images will be cut off outside the borders of the screen, and can also be used to remove black borders around the edges. This is useful if you want to play a movie on a TV, for example."

msgid "Other KWin Wayland improvements include the *Present Windows* effect (showing all the open windows when you move the cursor to the upper left-hand corner of the screen) working across the board exactly as on X11. You can now maximize windows vertically and/or horizontally. You can plug in an external graphics card and KWin will pick it up and configure it on the fly--no need to restart Plasma. And performance is now improved thanks to supporting direct scan-out for full-screen windows (only on non-NVIDIA GPUs for now). The increase in performance happens because KWin now avoids unnecessary copies of the screen contents when there is a game or application running full-screen. By not having to copy the screen over and over, playback runs faster."

That's why now you get a countdown: under _System Settings_ > _Display and Monitor_ > _Display Configuration_ , once you pick a resolution and press the _Apply_ button, a dialog window with the countdown will pop up. If after 30 seconds you haven't clicked the _Keep_ button (say, because your desktop has become inaccessible) the system will revert to the original, safe resolution. And this is just one of the ways of protecting you against accidental configuration mishaps."

Take, for example, _Night Color_: one of the things you can do is use geolocation to synchronize the color temperature of your screen with the periods of day and night of where you live. The _Night Color_ page in your _System Settings_ will tell you when sharing your location with a third party's service that provides the times of sunrise and sundown in your area, and will also tell you who said the third party is. Likewise, the _Feedback_ page now will show you a history of data that you have chosen to send to KDE. Note that _Feedback_ will always be set to _off_ by default.

This gives you more to pick from when copying, while at the same time decluttering the list by removing snippets you may have accidentally or absentmindedly highlighted while working with Plasma. To further help you keep things tidy, you can also remove selected items from the clipboard's popup by pressing the [Delete] key on the keyboard.

The system is more secure (e.g. key loggers are no longer trivial to implement) and follows the paradigm of 'every frame perfect' which makes screen tearing very difficult. With Plasma 5.4 the KDE community already provided a technology preview based on the feature set of the Phone project. With Plasma 5.5 this is now extended with more 'desktop style' usages. Important features like move/resize of windows is now supported as well as many integration features for the desktop shell. This allows for usage by early adopters, though we need to point out that it is not yet up to the task of fully replacing an X session. We encourage our more technical users to give it a try and report as many bugs as you can find."
