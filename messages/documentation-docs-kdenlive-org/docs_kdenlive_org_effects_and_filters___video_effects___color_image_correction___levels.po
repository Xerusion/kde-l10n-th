msgid "This effect/filter is very useful and important for correcting color levels. This is achieved by setting the darkest areas (black level) and the brightest (white level), thus adjusting contrast. With :guilabel:`Gamma` you set the overall brightness. To assist in making the adjustments, the effect has a built-in small histogram (see the warning below)."

This example shows a typical soft exposure profile, and that you have to adjust the **Black input level** and **White input level** to improve the contrast.
